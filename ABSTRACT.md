The authors have introduced a novel method for identifying pen ink differences in handwritten bank checks. They frame the problem as a binary classification task and extract thirty features for each word pair instance. These features serve as the basis for training a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier using known pen ink data. The performance of the MLP classifier is assessed on both known and unknown pen ink pixels. A thorough analysis and comparison of the results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method when compared to existing approaches, particularly for distinguishing between black and blue pen samples in handwritten checks.

Forensics in handwritten Bank cheques from the perspective of differentiating pen ink have great importance to the judicial system. In handwritten Bank cheque forensics, it is often important to establish a relation between the pen inks. It helps to identify whether a single pen has been used to write the Bank cheque or multiple pens. Numerous possibilities of fraud exist in handwritten Bank cheques. In this work, authors focus only on pen ink differentiation in Bank cheques. Possibilities of fraud in any Bank cheque and its consequences helps to understand the importance of the work.

Example of new words addition in Bank cheque using a different pen is depicted in Figure below which is elaborated as follows. The cheque was initially issued to Mr. Ravi Kumar Singh, amounting to Seventy thousand only. Later, forger appended new words in pay name and amount section as marked by red circles. This difference in pen ink can not be always perceived by naked eye. This type of case helps us to understand the possibility of addition of new words in handwritten Bank cheques. A number of handwritten document frauds are possible in bill, business agreement, educational documents, etc. This motivates us to differentiate pen ink in Bank cheques.

**Cheque Detection** dataset is extracted from the [IDRBT Cheque Image Dataset](http://www.idrbt.ac.in/icid.html) with diverse texture and ink color. Total 112 cheque leaves from four different Indian Banks are used as source document. In order to simulate the pen ink difference in cheque leaves, seven blue and seven black pens are used. To avoid biasness due to writing, nine different volunteers have taken active participation to prepare data set. A total of 14 × 9 = 126 pen−volunteer combinations (fourteen pens and nine volunteers) are used for pen ink data generation. In practical scenario, similar color pens are used for addition of new words in source document. Each cheque is written by two volunteers using two different pens (either blue or black). Hence, data set is created with 42 possible combinations of blue and black pens. All the cheque leaves are scanned in normal scanner at 300 dpi resolution. Handwritten words from each scanned cheque are cropped manually and grouped based on pen used to write the words.
